                  Prior studies of high school students consistently find that they are not receiving a good education in personal finance. Chen and Volpe (1998) find that college students are not receiving a good financial education. Mandell (1997) examines financial literacy for a sample of 1,509 high school seniors from 63 schools. The author reports an average correct score of 57% in the areas of income, money management, savings and investment, and spending. His conclusion is that students are leaving schools without the ability to make critical financial decisions affecting their lives.
                <br>
                Explanation: High school students are not receiving a good education in finance and college students aren’t either. Seniors in highschool had an average score of 57% for a financial literacy test. Therefore students are leaving school without the ability to make good financial decisions in life.	
              	 </td>
                <td>Financial literacy is something that can be taught in school, where it is not taught, studies show that GDP per capita and social equality is lower. The other way is also true, when financial literacy is taught to high school students, there has been a positive correlation to GDP per capita and social equality</td>
                <td>This implies that financial literacy does help with social equality. The US ranked poorly on this study, this is why there should be taught.

                  Highschool and college students are not receiving a good education in finance therefore they are going to fail in life.
