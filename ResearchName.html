            Root cause #1: Not teaching financial literacy is correlated with a lower GDP and social equality
            <br>
            Evidence: financial literacy is positively correlated with GDP per capita and social equality, 
            <br>
            Evidence: Prior studies of high school students consistently find that they are not receiving a good education in personal finance. Chen and Volpe (1998) find that college students are not receiving a good financial education. Mandell (1997) examines financial literacy for a sample of 1,509 high school seniors from 63 schools. The author reports an average correct score of 57% in the areas of income, money management, savings and investment, and spending. His conclusion is that students are leaving schools without the ability to make critical financial decisions affecting their lives.
            <br>
            Explanation: High school students are not receiving a good education in finance and college students arent either. Seniors in highschool had an average score of 57% for a financial literacy test. Therefore students are leaving school without the ability to make good financial decisions in life.
            <br>
            Implications:This implies that financial literacy does help with social equality. The US ranked poorly on this study, this is why there should be taught. Highschool and college students are not receiving a good education in finance therefore they are going to fail in life.

          Root cause #2: Financial literacy, financial education, and downstream financial behaviors.
          <br>
          Evidence: interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, 
          <br>
          Explanation:  There is little irregularity in the correlation between financial literacy and behaviors. 
          <br>
          Evidence: there are  “weaker effects in low-income samples.”
          <br>
          Explanation: Financial literacy has less of an effect on low income people
          <br>
          Implications:There is a correlation between financial literacy and financial behaviors. The correlation is lower for low-income people
